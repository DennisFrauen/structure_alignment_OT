# structure_alignment_OT
This repository contains the R code for the thesis "New approaches to protein structure alignment based on (Gromov)-Wasserstein distances" submitted to the University of GÃ¶ttingen on August 4th, 2021.

The code for the plots of chapter 4 and 5 is contained in the files "chapter_4.R", "chapter_51_real.R" and and "chapter_52_artificial.R". All other .R files contain the code for the alignment methods and are required to run "chapter_4.R", "chapter_51_real.R" and and "chapter_52_artificial.R". The protein structures considered in the thesis are available in the folder "protein_structures".
